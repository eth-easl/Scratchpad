# Scratchpad

This is an experimental LLM serving system, forked and built on top of [SGLang SRT](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/tree/main/python/sglang/srt), and is used to support [SwissAI Model Serving](https://serving.swissai.cscs.ch/).

## Adoption

- [SwissAI](https://serving.swissai.cscs.ch/) - as the primary serving engine for LLMs.
- [HexGen-Flow](https://github.com/Relaxed-System-Lab/Hexgen-Flow) - as a LLM execution simulator for Text-to-SQL application.
